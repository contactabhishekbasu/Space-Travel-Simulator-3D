## Project Overview

Space Travel Simulator 3D is a browser-based 3D solar system visualization using Three.js. It's a single-page application with no build process required - a sophisticated NASA Eyes-inspired educational tool with 4,000+ lines of core logic and 29+ specialized JavaScript modules.

## Running the Project

```bash
# Mac/Linux
./start-server.sh

# Windows
start-server.bat

# Manual
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
python server.py
```

Access at: http://localhost:8000

## Architecture

1. Three.js and loaders
2. Utility systems (blackhole-shader, planet-labels, etc.)
3. Core systems (ephemeris, time-controls, etc.)
4. Enhancement systems (atmosphere, rings, etc.)
5. Performance systems (optimization, texture-manager, etc.)

       name: "Display Name",
       position: new THREE.Vector3(x, y, z),
       size: radius,
       color: 0xHEXCOLOR,
       orbitRadius: AU_distance,
       orbitSpeed: radians_per_frame,
       info: "Brief description",

     }
   }
   ```

7. **Texture System**:
   - Supports 2K (low) and 8K (high) resolutions via `textures/low/` and `textures/high/`
   - Runtime quality switching with intelligent caching
   - Memory management with automatic cleanup
   - Spacecraft models in `textures/spacecraft/`
   - Multi-format support (JPG, PNG, WebP) with fallbacks

### Development Patterns

#### **System Initialization Pattern**
All systems use conditional initialization with error handling:
```javascript
if (typeof SystemClass !== 'undefined') {
    try {
        window.systemInstance = new SystemClass(scene, camera, renderer);
        devLog.success('System initialized');
    } catch (error) {
        devLog.error('Failed to initialize system:', error);
    }
}
```

#### **Global System Access**
Major systems are accessible globally via `window`:
- `window.ephemerisEngine` - Planetary positions
- `window.timeControls` - Time manipulation  
- `window.spacecraftTracker` - Mission tracking
- `window.textureManager` - Asset management
- `window.performanceDashboard` - Performance monitoring

#### **Error Handling & Logging**
- Built-in `devLog` system with success/error/warning levels
- Console export functionality for debugging
- Graceful degradation when systems fail to load
